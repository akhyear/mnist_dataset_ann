# 🖊️ MNIST Digit Recognition with ANN and Streamlit

A simple web app for handwritten digit recognition using the **MNIST dataset**.  
The model is built with an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**, trained and saved as a **pickle file**.  
With the app, you can either **upload an image** of a digit or **draw a digit** on the canvas, and the model will predict the number.
